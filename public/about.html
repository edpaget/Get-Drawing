<h2> GetDrawing: </h2>
<div class="about">

It is currently at version 0.3, and further improvements to both its drawing capabilites and scalability are planned.</p></div>
<h2> 55th St. Graffiti Wall: </h2>
<div class="about">
<p>Using photographs of graffiti around the Hyde Park and Washington Park neighbourhoods and my custom developed multi-user drawing engine, GetDrawing, 55th St. Graffiti Wall (named for the street that connects the neighbourhoods) is an interactive discussion of how political expression happens. In a world where mass media is increasingly controlled by fewer and fewer corporate conglomerates, those dissatisfied with the current state of outlets for political discussion often take to the internet as medium for expressing themselves in much the same way people who use graffiti do. Multiple users are able to draw simultaneously and are able to overwrite one another's changes. I hope my project demonstrates how: open (all source code from this project will be made available under the AGPL), anonymous (there is no identifying information about anyone who draws), collaborative atmosphere shapes the political debate around it.</p>
